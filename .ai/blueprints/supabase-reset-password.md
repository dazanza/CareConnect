To implement a password reset feature using Supabase, you can follow these steps based on the documentation provided:

## Overview of Password Reset Flow

The password reset process in Supabase consists of two main steps:
1. **Sending a Password Reset Email**: This step involves sending a link to the user's email address that allows them to reset their password.
2. **Updating the User's Password**: Once the user clicks the link and is redirected back to your application, they can enter a new password.

## Step 1: Sending a Password Reset Email

You can send a password reset request using the `resetPasswordForEmail` method. This method requires the user's email and an optional redirect URL where the user will be sent after clicking the reset link.

### Example Code

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail('user@example.com', {
  redirectTo: 'https://example.com/update-password',
});
```

- The `redirectTo` parameter specifies where users should be redirected after clicking the link in their email.

## Step 2: Updating the User's Password

After the user clicks on the password reset link in their email, they will be redirected back to your application. You can listen for authentication state changes to handle this event and prompt the user to enter a new password.

### Example Code

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(async (event, session) => {
    if (event === "PASSWORD_RECOVERY") {
      const newPassword = prompt("What would you like your new password to be?");
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword });
      
      if (data) alert("Password updated successfully!");
      if (error) alert("There was an error updating your password.");
    }
  });
}, []);
```

## Important Notes

- Ensure that you handle errors appropriately during both steps.
- The `onAuthStateChange` listener will emit a `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event when the user clicks on the recovery link.
- Make sure your application is set up to handle redirects correctly.

For further details and additional configurations, you can refer to the official Supabase documentation on [password-based authentication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwords) and [JavaScript API for resetting passwords](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail) [1][2].
