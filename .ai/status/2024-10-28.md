Development Steps
1. Created medical records and timeline infrastructure:
/supabase/migrations/20240312_medical_records.sql: Created tables for lab results, documents, timeline events
/supabase/migrations/20240312_medical_rls_policies.sql: Added comprehensive RLS policies
/app/types/timeline.ts: Defined timeline event types and interfaces
Implemented timeline components:
/app/components/medical-history/TimelineView.tsx: Main timeline view with filtering
/app/components/medical-history/TimelineEventCard.tsx: Individual event display
/app/lib/timeline-service.ts: Timeline data fetching and management
Added notification system:
/app/components/notifications/NotificationListener.tsx: Real-time notification listener
/app/components/notifications/NotificationsPopover.tsx: UI for notifications
/supabase/migrations/20240312_notification_cleanup.sql: Automated cleanup

Key Decisions
Used Supabase realtime subscriptions for notifications instead of polling
Implemented RLS policies at database level for security
Created automated cleanup jobs for old notifications
Used enum types for event categories to ensure data consistency
