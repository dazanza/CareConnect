## Notes

The project is using modern web development practices with a focus on type safety (TypeScript), component-based architecture (React/Next.js), and a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind). The use of Clerk for authentication and Supabase for backend services suggests a focus on rapid development and scalability.
