# Session Update: 2024-09-20

## Development Steps

1. `/app/api/patient-doctors/route.ts`: Updated API route handler for patient-doctor relationships
   - Implemented POST and GET methods using Clerk for authentication
   - Used Supabase for database operations

2. `/app/patients/[id]/page.tsx`: Enhanced patient details page
   - Implemented functionality to fetch and display patient details
   - Added feature to assign doctors to patients
   - Integrated error handling and success notifications using react-hot-toast

3. `/app/hooks/useSupabase.ts`: Refined Supabase hook for authentication
   - Integrated Clerk authentication with Supabase client
   - Implemented token-based authorization for Supabase requests

## Key Decisions

- Chose to use Clerk for authentication while maintaining Supabase for database operations
- Implemented client-side data fetching and state management in the patient details page for improved user experience
- Decided to handle authentication errors by redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page

## Next Steps

1. Add functionality to properly assign doctors to patients. Multiple doctors can be assigned to a single patient.
2. Implement error boundary and loading states for better user experience in patient details page
3. Add functionality to remove assigned doctors from patients
4. Implement pagination for doctor lists and patient-doctor relationships
5. Add unit tests for the new API routes and components

Progress: Completed the core functionality for managing patient-doctor relationships. Next session will focus on resolving type issues in the API route and enhancing error handling and user experience.
