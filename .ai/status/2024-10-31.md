# Session Update: 2024-10-31

## Development Steps

1. `/app/layout.tsx`: Fixed layout structure
   - Removed header component
   - Added proper sidebar container with `w-60 shrink-0`
   - Simplified content area with proper padding

2. `/app/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`: Updated sidebar implementation
   - Added fixed width container with `w-60 h-screen`
   - Moved UserButton to sidebar header
   - Improved sidebar content organization

3. Removed redundant layout files:
   - Deleted `/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
   - Deleted `/app/components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx`

## Key Decisions

- Chose to remove the header component and move UserButton to sidebar for cleaner layout
- Used fixed width with `shrink-0` to prevent content shifting
- Consolidated layout logic in root layout.tsx to avoid duplication
- Removed fixed positioning to prevent layout issues

## Next Steps

1. Fix linter errors for missing dependencies
   - Install required packages: @clerk/nextjs, lucide-react, react-hot-toast
   - Update Button component types to include variant and size props

2. Fix type errors in appointment handling
   - Update rescheduleAppointment function parameters
   - Fix type mismatch in cancelAppointment function

3. Update dialog component props
   - Add missing onOpenChange prop types to RescheduleAppointmentDialog
   - Add missing onOpenChange prop types to CancelAppointmentDialog

Progress: Fixed major layout issues and sidebar positioning. Next session will focus on resolving type errors and missing dependencies.
