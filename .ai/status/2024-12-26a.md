# Session Update: 2024-12-26a

## Development Steps

1. `app/patients/[id]/page.tsx`: Refactored data fetching architecture
   - Split useEffect into primary and secondary data fetches
   - Added individual loading states for each data type
   - Implemented proper error handling for each fetch operation
   - Fixed race conditions in data loading

2. `app/types/index.ts`: Enhanced type definitions
   - Added missing type interfaces for medical entities
   - Fixed type conflicts between components
   - Added proper type exports
   - Implemented stricter type checking for medical data

## Key Decisions

- Chose to split data fetching into two phases (patient data first, then related data) to prevent race conditions
- Implemented individual loading states per data type instead of a global loading state for better UX
- Decided to keep the original patient data fetching logic to maintain stability
- Used TypeScript interfaces instead of types for better code organization

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining type errors in components:
   - Resolve type mismatches in MedicalHistoryTimeline
   - Fix type conflicts in PrescriptionManager
   - Address type issues in AllergiesManager and MedicationsTracker

2. Implement proper error boundaries:
   - Add error boundary components for each major section
   - Implement fallback UI for failed data fetches
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed requests

3. Optimize component rendering:
   - Implement proper loading skeletons for each section
   - Add suspense boundaries for better loading states
   - Implement proper data caching strategy

Progress: Successfully refactored data fetching architecture and improved type safety. Next session will focus on resolving remaining type errors and implementing proper error handling.
