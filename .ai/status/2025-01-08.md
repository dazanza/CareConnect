# Session Update: 2025-01-08

## Development Steps

1. `app/hooks/usePatientAccess.ts`: Created new hook for patient access control
   - Implemented logic to check user's access level for patients
   - Added support for read/write/admin access levels

2. `app/components/documents/DocumentManager.tsx`: Updated access control
   - Added canEdit prop with default value of true
   - Conditionally rendered upload and delete buttons based on access level
   - Maintained view/download capabilities for read-only access

3. `app/components/VitalsTracker.tsx`, `app/components/MedicationsTracker.tsx`, `app/components/ImmunizationTracker.tsx`, `app/components/AllergiesManager.tsx`: Added access control
   - Implemented canEdit prop across all medical components
   - Disabled editing features for read-only access
   - Maintained consistent UI structure

## Key Decisions

- Implemented granular access control at component level rather than page level for better flexibility
- Maintained view/download capabilities for read-only access to ensure usability
- Used consistent canEdit prop pattern across all components for maintainability
- Kept UI structure consistent regardless of access level to prevent layout shifts

## Next Steps

1. Implement email notifications for patient sharing
   - Add email templates for share invitations
   - Set up email sending functionality using Resend
   - Include patient details and access level in emails

2. Improve real-time notifications for shares
   - Add toast notifications for new shares
   - Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions for share updates
   - Show notifications in the UI immediately

3. Add share management interface
   - Create UI for managing existing shares
   - Allow modifying access levels
   - Enable revoking access

4. Enhance error handling for sharing flows
   - Add better error messages for failed shares
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Show clear feedback to users

Progress: Completed access control implementation for shared patients. Next session will focus on improving the sharing notification system and implementing email functionality for better user communication.
