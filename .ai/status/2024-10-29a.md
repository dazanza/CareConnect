# Session Update: 2024-03-10

## Development Steps

1. `/app/hooks/useSupabase.ts`: Fixed Supabase auth integration with Clerk
   - Removed direct header modification
   - Used proper auth.setSession method
   - Added error handling

2. `/app/lib/dataFetching.ts`: Improved data fetching functions
   - Fixed user_id handling to use text instead of UUID
   - Added proper error handling and logging
   - Simplified query structure
   - Added filter method for text comparison

3. `/app/components/patients/PatientsContent.tsx` and `/app/components/doctors/DoctorsContent.tsx`: Updated components
   - Added proper loading states
   - Improved error handling
   - Added consistent data fetching patterns

4. `/types/supabase.ts`: Updated database types
   - Changed user_id type to string
   - Added proper typing for all tables

5. `/app/components/ui/loading-states.tsx`: Added loading state components
   - Created reusable loading state handling
   - Added skeleton loading patterns

## Key Decisions

- Chose to use Supabase's auth.setSession instead of modifying headers directly for better type safety
- Decided to handle user_id as text throughout the application to match database schema
- Implemented consistent error handling pattern across components
- Used filter method for text-based user_id comparison instead of eq
- Removed UUID casting in database queries

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper RLS policies for all tables
   - Remove UUID casting from existing policies
   - Add consistent text-based user_id handling

2. Add proper error boundaries and fallbacks
   - Implement error recovery strategies
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed requests

3. Improve loading state UX
   - Add progress indicators
   - Implement optimistic updates

Progress: Successfully fixed authentication and data fetching issues. Next session will focus on implementing proper RLS policies and improving error handling.
