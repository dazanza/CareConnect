# Session Update: 2024-10-02

## Development Steps

1. `app/components/AppTodoList.tsx`: Updated todo list component
   - Modified fetchTodos function to include patient information in Supabase query
   - Updated addTask function to handle patient name correctly
   - Adjusted rendering of todos to display patient name
   - Implemented nested select in Supabase queries for efficient data fetching

## Key Decisions

- Chose to use nested selects in Supabase queries to fetch related data efficiently
- Decided to display patient name directly in todo items for better user experience

## Next Steps

1. Resolve type errors in AppTodoList.tsx:
   - Fix type mismatch for patient_id and appointment_id (currently string, should be number)
   - Remove or replace console.log statement causing 'void' type error
2. Implement error handling for cases where patient data might be missing
3. Add pagination or infinite scrolling for todo list to handle large numbers of todos
4. Create a separate component for adding new todos to improve code organization
5. Implement filtering and sorting options for the todo list

Progress: Successfully updated the AppTodoList component to display patient names and improved data fetching efficiency. Next session will focus on resolving type errors and further enhancing the todo list functionality.
