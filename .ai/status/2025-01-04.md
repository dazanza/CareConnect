# Session Update: 2025-01-04

## Development Steps

1. `app/components/patients/PatientShares.tsx`: Fixed user data display
   - Updated component to handle undefined doctor name properties
   - Modified to use first_name and last_name instead of name

2. `app/lib/patient-sharing.ts`: Refactored data fetching logic
   - Separated patient shares and user data queries
   - Implemented two-step data fetching to handle auth.users access
   - Added proper error handling for both queries
   - Fixed TypeScript issues with Set operations

## Key Decisions

- Decided to split the data fetching into two separate queries instead of using joins due to auth.users table access limitations
- Used in-memory data combination instead of database joins to maintain type safety and handle auth.users restrictions
- Implemented proper null checking and optional chaining for user data to improve reliability

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper error boundaries around the PatientShares component
   - Add loading states
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Handle edge cases like expired shares

2. Add caching for user data
   - Implement client-side caching to reduce database queries
   - Consider using React Query or SWR

3. Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Define interfaces for share data
   - Add proper typing for user data
   - Document expected data shapes

Progress: Fixed critical issues with patient sharing functionality. Next session will focus on improving error handling and user experience.
