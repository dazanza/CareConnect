# Session Update: 2025-01-07

## Development Steps

1. `app/(authenticated)/shared/page.tsx`: Enhanced patient sharing functionality
   - Fixed user information display by updating Supabase query with correct foreign key relationships
   - Added share management UI with edit and end share buttons
   - Improved icon clarity by replacing UserPlus/UserMinus with Share2/UserCheck
   - Added tooltips and clear button labels for better UX
   - Implemented share management functions (handleEndShare, handleEditShare)
   - Added success/error toasts for user feedback

## Key Decisions

- Used explicit foreign key relationships in Supabase queries (`users!shared_by_user_id` and `users!shared_with_user_id`) to fix user information display
- Implemented granular access control with read/write toggle instead of a more complex permission system
- Added immediate UI feedback with toast messages and automatic refresh after share actions
- Separated share management into distinct functions for better maintainability

## Next Steps

1. Add confirmation dialogs before ending shares to prevent accidental deletions
2. Implement share expiration date modification in the edit functionality
3. Add batch operations for managing multiple shares at once
4. Consider adding share history or audit log for tracking changes

Progress: Completed core share management functionality. Next session will focus on improving the user experience with confirmation dialogs and additional share management features.
