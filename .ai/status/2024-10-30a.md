 # Session Update: 2024-10-30

## Development Steps

1. `app/components/ui/skeleton.tsx`: Created base skeleton component
   - Implemented reusable skeleton component with Tailwind classes
   - Added proper TypeScript types

2. `app/components/ui/skeletons.tsx`: Consolidated skeleton variants
   - Moved all skeleton components to a single file
   - Implemented PatientCardSkeleton, AppointmentSkeleton, and TodoListSkeleton

3. `app/appointments/page.tsx`: Fixed appointment data fetching
   - Updated Supabase query to handle nested doctor and patient data
   - Added proper data transformation for doctor names
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in appointment interface

4. `app/patients/[id]/page.tsx`: Updated patient details page
   - Fixed data fetching for patient doctors
   - Updated vitals query to use date_time instead of created_at
   - Added proper error handling for missing tables

## Key Decisions

- Chose to consolidate all skeleton components in app/components/ui/skeletons.tsx for better organization
- Decided to handle doctor names by concatenating first_name and last_name in data transformation
- Removed references to non-existent tables (allergies, medications, immunizations) until they're created
- Updated queries to match actual database schema structure

## Next Steps

1. Create missing database tables
   - Add allergies table with proper schema
   - Add medications table with doctor relationship
   - Add immunizations table with required fields

2. Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add error boundary components for each major section
   - Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
   - Add user-friendly error messages

3. Fix type issues in data fetching
   - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all database tables
   - Update state types to match database types
   - Add proper type guards for data transformation

Progress: Fixed major data fetching issues and skeleton component organization. Next session will focus on implementing missing database tables and improving type safety.
