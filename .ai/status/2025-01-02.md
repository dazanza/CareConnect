# Session Update: 2025-01-02

## Development Steps

1. `app/lib/dataFetching.ts`: Updated data fetching functions
   - Removed Clerk imports
   - Fixed getCachedAppointments function to use proper options pattern
   - Improved search query patterns with ilike and or conditions

2. `app/lib/supabase.ts`: Simplified Supabase client initialization
   - Removed Clerk-specific token handling
   - Switched to createClientComponentClient for simpler auth integration
   - Removed unnecessary state management

3. `app/doctors/[id]/page.tsx`: Updated doctor page authentication
   - Replaced Clerk's useAuth with Supabase's useAuth
   - Updated user ID access pattern from userId to user.id
   - Simplified data fetching with proper error handling

4. `app/family-groups/page.tsx`: Updated family groups page
   - Migrated to Supabase Auth
   - Simplified component structure
   - Fixed import for FamilyGroupList component

## Key Decisions

- Adopted a consistent pattern for auth migration across components:
  - Replace Clerk's useAuth with Supabase's useAuth
  - Update user ID access patterns
  - Remove Clerk-specific hooks and imports

- Standardized data fetching patterns:
  - Use ilike for main search condition with or for additional fields
  - Pass options object with spread operator for type safety
  - Maintain consistent error handling with toast notifications

- Simplified Supabase client initialization:
  - Removed complex token handling in favor of built-in auth
  - Use createClientComponentClient for automatic session management

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining components to use Supabase Auth:
   - Review all components for any remaining Clerk imports
   - Update any components still using Clerk's user management
   - Test auth flow across all protected routes

2. Implement proper error boundaries:
   - Add error boundary components around main content areas
   - Create consistent error handling patterns
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed data fetches

3. Add loading states:
   - Implement skeleton loaders for data fetching
   - Add loading indicators for auth state changes
   - Ensure smooth transitions between states

Progress: Completed core auth migration from Clerk to Supabase. Next session will focus on completing the migration across all components and implementing proper error handling.
