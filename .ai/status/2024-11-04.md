# Session Update: 2024-11-04

## Development Steps

1. `/app/types/`: Reorganized type definitions
   - Split types into domain-specific files (medications.ts, patients.ts, etc.)
   - Fixed type inconsistencies with database schema
   - Added proper nullability based on database columns
   - Removed duplicate interfaces

2. `/app/types/index.ts`: Updated central type exports
   - Added proper exports from domain files
   - Fixed circular dependencies
   - Added missing form-related interfaces
   - Ensured consistent ID types

3. `/app/components/prescriptions/PrescriptionForm.tsx`: Fixed type issues
   - Updated form data handling to match schema
   - Added proper type conversions for Select components
   - Fixed medication and doctor relationship handling

4. `/app/components/AppTodoList.tsx`: Enhanced patient selection
   - Added patient selector component
   - Fixed type issues with patient relationships
   - Improved error handling and loading states

## Key Decisions

- Chose to organize types by domain in separate files for better maintainability
- Implemented strict type checking against database schema
- Kept form-related interfaces separate from database types
- Used string conversion for Select component values to fix type issues
- Maintained backward compatibility where needed

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining linter errors
   - Add missing imports
   - Resolve circular dependencies
   - Fix type mismatches in components

2. Implement proper error handling
   - Add error boundaries
   - Improve error messages
   - Add loading states

3. Add form validation
   - Implement Zod schemas
   - Add client-side validation
   - Improve error feedback

Progress: Completed major type reorganization and fixed critical type issues. Next session will focus on resolving remaining linter errors and implementing proper validation.
