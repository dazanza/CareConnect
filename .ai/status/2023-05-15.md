# Project Status: 2023-05-15

## Current State
The project is a Next.js 14 application using the App Router. It's built with TypeScript and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The project incorporates Shadcn UI components, Supabase for backend services, and Clerk for authentication.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI (with Radix UI primitives)
- Supabase
- Clerk Auth
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation

## Recent Decisions
- Chose Next.js 14 with App Router for the project structure
- Implemented Clerk for authentication
- Selected Supabase as the backend service
- Adopted Shadcn UI for component library

## Completed Tasks
- Set up the basic Next.js 14 project with App Router
- Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up Clerk authentication
- Integrated Supabase for backend services
- Implemented Shadcn UI components
- Set up React Hook Form with Zod for form handling and validation

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review and optimize the current component structure
- [ ] Implement key features utilizing Supabase (specifics needed)
- [ ] Enhance authentication flows and protected routes with Clerk
- [ ] Create additional UI components as needed
- [ ] Set up proper error handling and loading states
- [ ] Implement responsive design for all components
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components and functions

## Challenges/Blockers
- None identified at this stage, but more information may be needed

## Notes
The project is using modern web development practices with a focus on type safety (TypeScript), component-based architecture (React/Next.js), and a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind). The use of Clerk for authentication and Supabase for backend services suggests a focus on rapid development and scalability.
